# Stopwatch Application
This is a stopwatch program I wrote in Java using Apache NetBeans IDE as a personal project. I created this project as a means to sharpen my GUI skills in 
Swing and also to help new beginners who might be viewing this repo get their head in the game. 

Although the critically acclaimed Swing library is neccessarily 
a  "bad choice" for creation of GUI or applications, owing to problems such as non-thread safety and lengthy code, it still is a good starting point for a
developer going for front end and/or desktop development. It gives the programmer full control over its intricate workings and its robust systems are for you to 
explore.

Lastly, the source code contains a lot of unoptimized code which make the application perform sub-par. Anyone who wishes to make a change to the source code and
improve its performance and "bad code issues" are welcome to do so. Since this code was written for the sake of making and project and not to make a fully fledged application, it features a lot of bugs and inefficient code.
