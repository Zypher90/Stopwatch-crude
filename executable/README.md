# Executable File
This is a executable version of the stopwatch project listed in this repo. Sadly, the executable does not don a icon and I am too stubborn and lazy to figure out
why not. If any of the people viewing this repo has any idea as to why the icon disappears, please be my gueat and fix it in the code.

# Important Note
During direct launch or execution, the executable .jar throws a JNI exception and refuses to launch. Therefore, it is advised to navigate to the clone repo 
through your terminal and launch executable using command "java -jar Stopwatch.jar".
The JNI exception is mostly thrown due to unmatching JRE and JDK versions but in this case that is not so. Viewers of this repository are welcome to commit 
a bug fix to this major issue.
